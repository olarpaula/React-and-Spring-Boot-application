In our eternal quest for youthful, glowing skin, facial oils have come of age. Nothing locks in moisture and creates instant fresh-looking, dewy skin like the latest slick operators.

A face oil should be used as the last step in your skincare routine, rather than a replacement for your daily moisturiser or night cream. It’s a common misconception that they actually hydrate the skin when scientifically speaking, “they are occlusives meaning they act as sealants on the skin surface,” says Dr Sharon Wong, dermatologist based at The Shard, London. They do this by creating a protective layer over our complexions that prevents any moisture from escaping.

While dry skin types will have the most to gain from this moisture boost, enhancing the hydrating effects of your moisturiser is something all skin types can gain from. After all, skin looks its best when plump and well-nourished. And don’t be put off if you’ve got combination or oily skin, as there are targeted formulas that can balance skin’s sebum levels too.
