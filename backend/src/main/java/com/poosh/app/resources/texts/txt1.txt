When it comes to moisturising, even those with the most high-maintenance beauty regimes are often guilty of neglecting the skin below the neck area.

More than an indulgence, experts believe that body moisturisers should be a staple in our daily routine.

“The skin on the body requires the same attention to that of the face, yet it seems to be more of an afterthought for people,” says consultant dermatologist Dr Alia Ahmed.

“Skin here is subject to friction from clothing and is faced with stressors such as temperature change, exposure to UV rays and moisture-sapping hot water from baths and showers, so building a healthy skin barrier through moisturising can help to protect and heal it,” she adds.

The best time to use a body moisturiser is immediately after a bath or shower – while the skin is still damp. “This helps the product to penetrate and will seal in moisture,” advises Dr Ahmed.
